# INTERACTIVE-QUIZ-APPLICATION

# *Quizzy Quest* 🎮

## 📖 Project Overview

**Quizzy Quest** is a responsive and interactive frontend quiz application built to provide a fun, engaging, and challenging learning experience. It features a clean UI, smooth animations, level-based progression, and instant feedback, making it more than a traditional quiz app.

Users start by signing up or logging in, then land on an attractive **welcome screen** where they can choose a category and begin their quiz. The app is structured into **levels**, each containing a fixed number of questions. Question difficulty automatically increases as players advance, and one wrong answer or a timeout ends the game, sending the user to a **summary screen**. This design adds replayability and a game-like challenge.
